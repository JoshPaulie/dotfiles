# dotfiles
Welcome to my dotfiles! They're meant to be universal between MacOS and GNU/Linux, and only contain config files for tools which would be present on both platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Actually getting the tools onto the system is outside the scope of this repo

## Install
```sh
git clone <repo> ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
sh setup.sh
```
