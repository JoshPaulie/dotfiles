# dotfiles
Welcome to my dotfiles! They're meant to be universal between MacOS and GNU/Linux, and only contain config files for tools which would be present on both platforms.

## Install
> [!IMPORTANT]
> dotfile dependencies like `stow` and `git` might not be present on the system. Instead of running the setup script directly, it should be invoked by one of the included bootstrapping scripts.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JoshPaulie/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
